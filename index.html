                            I am a student who loves to learn about computers! I enjoy programming in a multitude of languages
                            (Bash, Python, HTML, CSS, Juypter-Notebooks and SQL just to name a few!). I work with Linux distros on
                            a daily basis (mostly Arch and Debian derivatives) and I am able to utilise the command-line to a great extent.
                            I am working on learning more about VIM, Machine Learning, Penetration Testing (specifically Social-Engineering
                            tools like SET and Metasploit). I often work with hardware, having built (and repaired) many PCs and Servers. I often
                            help teach others more about staying safe online, and how to utilise their hardware to the fullest. I love working with others,
                            and I aim to help others just like I have had people help me! Have a look at my

                                 learning more about machine learning
                                 using TensorFlow, and how to use VIM more efficiently. I use GitHub extensively,
                                 with most of my projects being based on the platform, I also use many programs to program, including
                                 Visual Studio Code, Vim (mostly Vim-on-VSCode), Kite, GitHub Desktop and MarkText (for .md files in general).

                                I am competent with Juypter-Notebooks, and I hope to use them more often. I use Google Colaboratory
                                for my work, and I aim to work on my own hardware when I am able to. I hope to explore more about
                                this field, and I think this is a skill that will allow for me to work with programs in a more complete way.

                                 I am proficient with using Linux for troubleshooting, and have run a Linux server before.
                                 I enjoy working with electronics, and my list of things that I have fixed range from an Apple Watch

                             I have experience in using Bash, package managers including APT and Pacman. I currently utilise
                             a Linux setup on my Programming Machine, using ElementaryOS. I am able to use Linux proficiently,
                             using it mainly for programming and as a way to learn something new. I am able to use Linux in troubleshooting,
                             and I often do things such as reset passwords, recover data from drives, fix corrupted installations of OSs, etc.
                             I am an avid open-source user, and I hope to contribute as I improve my skills.

                             as a whole, and that is what I aim to be my specialty in this aspect. I am skilled in Social-Engineering, 
                             I am able to speak confidently, and get information from people in a way that is not awkward or jarring. 
                             I can also speak with others, and I am careful with words, being able to change my demeanor at the drop of a hat.
                             I have used many different tools, such as SET, Metasploit, AircrackNG, etc., and although I would 
                             not call myself that good, I am learning more about the field and how to use the tools
                             effectively. I am able to do things quite easily, such as resetting passwords, finding small
                             exploits in Web-Applications for example. I aim to become more knowledgeable in the 'Hacking' field,
                             as I believe that it can be useful in the future.
