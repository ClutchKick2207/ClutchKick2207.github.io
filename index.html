      <h2><b>How it forms</b></h2>
      <h3> Magnetite is difficult to find by itself (it can be found in small quantities in Igneous rocks, and it is quite common). In these igneous rocks, intrusive rocks bear the biggest and larger amounts of dense, crystalised magnetite. To find a pure sample, you would have to find it in a sedimentary rock (these date between 3.9 and 1.6 billion years old). This occured due to the little amount of Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and the high amount of iron in the oceans. Oxygen levels rose due to the early photosynthesing plants, which then reacted with the dissolved iron, which then created iron oxides (that settled on the floor of the early oceans). As the amount of oxygen increased, production slowed of Magnetite, until about 1.6 billion years ago, when there was too much oxygen in the atmosphere to be able to react with the (now) minimal amount of iron in the oceans. This reaction is not possible naturally anymore. </h3>

      <h2><b>Mineral Chemistry</b></h2>
      <h3>This mineral is used mostly for decoration and jewlerry, so there is no useful elements that could be extracted from the mineral</h3>
